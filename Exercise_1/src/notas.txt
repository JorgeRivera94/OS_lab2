Instrucciones

* Create a C program named greetings that prints 
    “hello there, I’m process <pid>” 
    on screen and waits 10 seconds to print the message 
    “I’m done, bye!”.

* Make another program that creates three children using fork(). 
    Each child will print the message “I’m a child, and my id 
    is: <pid>” before creating two more children and waiting for 
    them to end. The children of the child processes must use the 
    exec() function to invoke the greetings program.

* Print the process tree using the “pstree -c -n” command in a 
    terminal, and include a screenshot in the project folder to 
    submit it with the source code.

* Upload a compressed file with the project's folder, including the "src" and "include" directories and the cmakelists.txt file. The program will not be evaluated if it does not compile correctly with the cmakelists.txt file.
